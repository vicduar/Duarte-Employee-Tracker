#Unit 3 Challenge

##Description

Work on this project was implemented at the request of the client, whose user story stated the following: "AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company.”

The specific topics covered in the creation of this project include arrays, functions, methods, variable and constants, for and while loops, and using Chrome Dev Tools to ensure that errors in coding are identified and resolved quickly.

The project solves the problem of the employer being unable to track his employees, their salaries, their combined average salary, and the employer’s inability to identify a random employee.

A great deal of knowledge was obtained through the design and completion of this project, from fortifying knowledge of HTML and CSS, learning JavaScript, research of questions using the internet, the process of using Git and Github, and learning how to debug broken code.

The steps required to start the development environment running include: opening VS Code, Github, Git (and Terminal). Once the project was created on my local repo then it was linked to Github, to save changes as updates are made. In Github, a remote repo is created and linked via Git. Once this link was made using several Git terminal commands, the project was intitiated. The project was created using VS Code. It is here that the bulk of time designing was spent. Following these steps, the project and changes were uploaded to Github. The final project was then deployed to the web.

Below are screenshots of the project in various stages following the client’s approval and just before deployment:

3. An image of the console and main page after data entry of two employees, showing the employee names, salaries, average salary, and the random employee chosen.

After completion of this project all of the following acceptance criteria have been met:

GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data.
